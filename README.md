# Love-calulator
The Love Calculator provides a score from 0% to 100% that is meant to be an indication of a match in terms of love, based on the names of two people. The higher the percentage, the better the match. 

# Input collection
The user is prompted to enter names.
Two names are input: one for the user and the other for the "crush" or partner.

# Algorithm
The calculation is based on a simple, predefined formula.
Name-Based Calculations:
Character Matching: Assign a numerical value to each letter (e.g. A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).
Add the values of the letters in both names.
Apply a modulus operation or reduce the sum to a percentage (e.g.sum % 100).

# Display of Results
The tool presents the "compatibility" as a percentage(e.g."80% â€“ Perfect Match!").

# Entertainment and Fun Factor
The calculator is designed to be entertaining rather than accurate.
